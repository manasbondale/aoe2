**Introduction:**

Ello is a Discord bot specifically tailored for Age of Empires 2 communities, offering a range of features designed to enhance the gaming experience and community interaction. Launched in October, Ello has rapidly gained popularity and is now utilized by over 5000+ users worldwide. What sets Ello apart from other Age of Empires 2 bots is its unique capabilities, including creating clickable lobby links, connecting Discord profiles to in-game stats, generating internal leaderboards, analyzing replays, and providing player statistics.

**Key Features:**

1. **Clickable Lobby Links:**
   Ello creates clickable lobby links using the `aoe2de://0/....` schema. By leveraging a proxy HTTP server, Ello circumvents Discord's policy restrictions, allowing users to easily join Age of Empires 2 lobbies directly from Discord.

2. **Profile Integration:**
   Ello enables users to connect their Discord profiles with their Age of Empires 2 game profiles, facilitating seamless access to in-game statistics and information.

3. **Internal Leaderboard:**
   Ello automatically generates internal leaderboards within group chats based on players' in-game statistics. This feature fosters friendly competition and enhances community engagement.

4. **Replay Analysis:**
   Users can send replays to the bot, and Ello will analyze them, providing a comprehensive summary of the gameplay. This functionality aids in strategizing, learning, and improving gameplay skills.

5. **Player Search:**
   Ello allows users to search for any profile name and receive detailed statistics for potential matches. This feature is invaluable for scouting opponents and strategizing before matches.

**Hosting:**

Ello is currently hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, ensuring reliability, scalability, and optimal performance for all users.
